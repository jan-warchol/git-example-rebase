Where are orange and violet?
----------------------------

Selenized [defines](the-values.md) 8 accent colors: red, orange, yellow, green,
cyan, blue, violet and magenta. However, terminal emulators traditionally have
escape codes for 6 colors (red, yellow, green, cyan, blue and magenta), with
two additional codes for black and white. Therefore, terminal configs included
in this repository don't include orange and violet. However, configs for GUI
programs will include the full palette (as GUI programs can define as many
colors as they want).


Syntax highlighting design principles
-------------------------------------

Here are some general guidelines for deciding which types of tokens should be
colored with which color:

- overall effect shouldn't be overwhelming - don't color everything, strive for
  harmony (compare with [this monokai
  example](https://i.imgur.com/ATVTHr6.png), which has colors all over the
  place)
- contrasting colors shouldn't appear next to each other too often
- structurally most important elements should be most visible
- less important content should be visually "in the background"
- short tokens (and punctuation, if it's to be colored) should preferably use
  stronger colors 
- long tokens should use "softer" colors to avoid making the result too
  aggressive
- rare tokens should use a color that draws attention and is not used by some
  common tokens
- try to leverage common color associations wherever possible (e.g. red ->
  problem, green -> no problem)
- warm colors (orange, yellow) are best for tokens associated with action
- cold colors (cyan, blue) are best for things that don't change
- [non-spectral colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color) (purple,
  magenta) are best for things with special meaning/behavior

This means that, for example:

- comments must be gray, so that they fade into background (unlike many schemes
  in which comments are green and clutter the view)
- function and class definitions must be clearly visible from distance (perhaps
  bright bold foreground)
- orange is a good color for numbers
- exceptions should probably be bold and they must not be green
- preprocessor, interpolation, macros and other meta-processing things "feel"
  magenta
- cyan is a good color for `CONSTANTS`
- should boilerplate be blue? or gray? or not colored at all?


Development
-----------

Selenized is still work-in-progress.  Here are some of my plans for the future:
- add ready-to-use config files for more terminals
- support more command-line programs (add selenized skins/configs for them - in
  particular I'd like to fine-tune dircolors to look as good as possible with
  Selenized)
- add a dark-on-light variant of the palette
- extend Selenized to 8 accent colors (add orange and violet, like in
  Solarized)
- add color schemes for popular IDEs
- add a script that would allow [adjusting Selenized to your taste](#forking)
  using a web interface
- maybe even create a library that would allow adjusting LAB lightness in
  arbitrary color palettes based on the experience I got creating Selenized
- research perceptually uniform color spaces - maybe they could be used to
  improve consistency of Selenized colors even further?  See
  [here](www.brucelindbloom.com/UPLab.html) and
  [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system).

If you'd like to help with any of these, please get in touch - open a pull
request or contact me at jan.warchol@gmail.com.

Also, open an issue if you found a program that doesn't look good with
Selenized terminal or encountered a situation where Selenized was not readable
enough.  Until version 1.0 I'm open to suggestions on adjusting the colors.



Forking
-------

You are welcome to adjust Selenized to your taste - I can imagine that some
people may want to change the hue of the background/content colors or adjust
the contrast slightly.  When doing so, please keep in mind the following
(especially if you'd like to publish your fork and use "Selenized" in its
name):
- always use CIELAB color space to check lightness of the resulting colors.
  You don't need Photoshop for this - there are online tools for CIELAB-sRGB
  conversion (although they may produce slightly different results than
  Photoshop).
- keep overall contrast (i.e. difference in CIELAB lightness between foreground
  and background colors) between 45 and 65 units.  Anything outside this range
  is really not good.
- keep accent color contrast (i.e. difference in CIELAB lightness between
  accent color and background) above 30 units. This really is the minimum.
- preferably don't change accent color hues and their relative lightness at
  all.
